### Ticket-2001: Select a subset of conversations for fine-grained LLM analysis

**Description**
- Select a meaningful subset of conversations for LLM analysis based on BERTopic results.

**Tasks**
- Review the topics and representative conversations from the BERTopic analysis.
- Develop a strategic approach to select a meaningful subset prioritizing:
  - High Business Value Topics (e.g., customer pain points, user intent, common support inquiries).
  - Nuanced Interpretation (topics requiring deep semantic understanding).
- Save the selected subset to `data/03_processed/` in a format suitable for the next step.

**Recommended Tools**
- `Pandas`, Jupyter Notebooks.

**How to Test**
- Test: Verify that a new file is created in the `data/03_processed/` directory.
- Test: Manually inspect the subset to ensure it contains conversations from the targeted topics.
