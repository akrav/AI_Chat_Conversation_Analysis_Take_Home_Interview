### **Sprint 2 Overview: LLM-Enhanced Analysis & Final Deliverables**

This sprint builds upon the foundational work of Sprint 1 by focusing on fine-grained, LLM-driven analysis and the final generation of actionable insights for stakeholders. The objective is to apply a structured, hybrid approach to transform conversational data into strategic intelligence.

-----

### **Major Functionality Delivered**

  * **Subsetting & Fine-Grained Analysis:** A subset of the data is selected based on the BERTopic results and processed using a Large Language Model (LLM) for more nuanced analysis.
  * **Final Insights Document:** The final output is a comprehensive, well-documented markdown file containing key findings, visualizations, and conversational examples.
  * **Reproducibility:** The entire analytical process is well-documented with code, comments, and explanations to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

### **Sprint Tickets**

**Ticket-2001: Select a subset of conversations for fine-grained LLM analysis**
\<br\> **Description:** Select a **meaningful** subset of conversations for LLM analysis. **Meaningful** selection involves identifying topics from the BERTopic analysis that show high business value or require a more nuanced, semantic understanding than can be provided by the initial topic model.
\<br\> **Tasks:**

  * Review the topics and representative conversations from the BERTopic analysis.
  * Develop a strategic approach to select a meaningful subset of the data for deeper analysis. This selection should prioritize:
      * **High Business Value Topics:** Topics related to customer pain points for product improvement, user intent for marketing messages, or common customer support inquiries.
      * **Nuanced Interpretation:** Topics that are ambiguous or require deep semantic understanding to extract actionable insights.
  * Save the selected subset to `data/03_processed/` in a format suitable for the next step.
    \<br\> **Recommended Tools:** `Pandas`, Jupyter Notebooks.
    \<br\> **How to Test:**
  * **Test:** Verify that a new file is created in the `data/03_processed/` directory.
  * **Test:** Manually inspect the subset to ensure it contains conversations from the targeted topics.

-----

**Ticket-2002: Perform fine-grained analysis using LLMs**
\<br\> **Description:** Implement a script to perform fine-grained analysis on the selected subset of conversations using a Large Language Model (LLM).
\<br\> **Tasks:**

  * Implement a Python script to interact with a Large Language Model API (e.g., OpenAI API).
  * Develop prompts to categorize, summarize, or extract specific information (e.g., user intent, sentiment) from the conversations in the subset.
  * Store the results of the LLM analysis in a structured format, such as a new DataFrame with the extracted features.
    \<br\> **Recommended Tools:** Python, `openai` library, `requests` library.
    \<br\> **How to Test:**
  * **Test:** Run the script on a small sample to confirm successful API interaction and that the LLM returns the expected output.
  * **Test:** Check that the output is saved to the correct location and contains the new analytical features.
  * If a test fails: Analyze the error and loop to fix. This might require updating the `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Troubleshooting.md` file.
    \<br\> Reminder to AI Coder: After completing this ticket, please update `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Sprint-Progress.md`.

**Ticket-2003: Synthesize findings and create visualizations**
\<br\> **Description:** Aggregate findings from both the BERTopic and LLM analysis and create the visualizations required for the final insights document.
\<br\> **Tasks:**

  * Combine the results from the BERTopic analysis (`data/04_analysis/bertopic_results.csv`) and the LLM analysis (`data/04_analysis/llm_results.csv`) into a unified data structure.
  * Generate a visualization showing the frequency of topics over time. This will help identify trends.
  * Create a bar chart to show the distribution of LLM-classified user intents.
  * Generate visualizations that illustrate the relationship between LLM-categorized sentiment and specific topics.
  * Save all generated visualizations in the `reports/images` folder.
    \<br\> **Recommended Tools:** Python, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
    \<br\> **How to Test:**
  * **Test:** Verify that visualizations are successfully generated and saved to the `reports/images` folder with appropriate filenames.
  * **Test:** Visually inspect the charts to ensure they accurately represent the data and are clearly labeled.
  * If a test fails: Analyze the error and loop to fix. This might require updating the `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Troubleshooting.md` file.
    \<br\> Reminder to AI Coder: After completing this ticket, please update `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Sprint-Progress.md`.

**Ticket-2004: Generate final insights document and strategic recommendations**
\<br\> **Description:** Create the final, comprehensive insights document by synthesizing all findings and linking them to actionable brand strategies.
\<br\> **Tasks:**

  * Create a new markdown file named `Insights Document.md` in the `reports/` folder.
  * Write an **Executive Summary** that highlights key findings from both analyses. **Key findings** should focus on high-frequency topics, emerging or underserved areas of interest, and the tangible business value of the insights.
  * Integrate the visualizations created in Ticket-2003 into the document, ensuring they are properly referenced and explained.
  * Include specific conversational snippets from the LLM analysis that serve as examples to illustrate key insights.
  * Add a section on **Strategic Recommendations** that clearly links the data-driven insights to practical applications for brands (e.g., product improvement, tailored marketing messages, streamlining customer support).
    \<br\> **Recommended Tools:** Markdown.
    \<br\> **How to Test:**
  * **Test:** Verify that the `Insights Document.md` file is created in the correct directory.
  * **Test:** Manually review the document to ensure all required components (summary, visualizations, examples, recommendations) are present, well-formatted, and clearly communicated.
  * If a test fails: Analyze the error and loop to fix. This might require updating the `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Troubleshooting.md` file.
    \<br\> Reminder to AI Coder: After completing this ticket, please update `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Sprint-Progress.md`.
