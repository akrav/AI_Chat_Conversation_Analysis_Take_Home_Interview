### Ticket-2004: Generate final insights document and strategic recommendations

**Description**
- Create the final, comprehensive insights document by synthesizing findings and linking them to actionable brand strategies.

**Tasks**
- Create `Insights Document.md` in the `reports/` folder.
- Write an Executive Summary highlighting key findings from both analyses (high-frequency topics, emerging/underserved areas, business value).
- Integrate visualizations from Ticket-2003, properly referenced and explained.
- Include conversational snippets from the LLM analysis that illustrate key insights.
- Add a section on Strategic Recommendations linking insights to practical brand actions (product improvement, marketing messages, support workflows).

**Recommended Tools**
- Markdown.

**How to Test**
- Test: Verify `Insights Document.md` exists in `reports/`.
- Test: Manually review to ensure all required components are present, well-formatted, and clear.
- If a test fails: Analyze the error and loop to fix. Update `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Troubleshooting.md` if needed.
