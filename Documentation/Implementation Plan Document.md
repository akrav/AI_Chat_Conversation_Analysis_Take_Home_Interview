### 1\. Overview & Project Goals

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the **AI Conversation Analytics** project. The plan is designed to follow a structured, reproducible data science workflow, transforming the `allenai/WildChat` dataset into actionable insights for brand strategists. The methodology is a hybrid approach, combining a scalable topic modeling technique with fine-grained analysis using a Large Language Model (LLM) and other NLP tools for semantic analysis.

The project's deliverables, as outlined in the Product Requirements Document and Architecture Document, will be a collection of well-documented files within a Git repository, including a `Data Exploration File`, `Task Files`, and a `Final Insights Document`. The estimated timeline for the project is approximately 12 hours.

### 2\. Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Exploration

**Objective:** To establish the foundational environment for the project and perform a comprehensive initial analysis of the dataset.

1.  **Environment and Repository Setup**

      * **Action:** Create the project repository and establish the standard data science project structure as defined in the Architecture Document.
      * **Tools:** Git, virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
      * **Deliverable:** A complete repository with the correct folder structure (`data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `reports/`, and `Build Documentation/`).

2.  **Data Ingestion & Preparation**

      * **Action:** Programmatically load the `allenai/WildChat` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
      * **Action:** Perform initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure, identify missing values, and analyze metadata such as language and model used.
      * **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Hugging Face `datasets`.
      * **Deliverable:** A `Data Exploration File` (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook) documenting the data loading, cleaning, and initial findings. The processed data will be saved to `data/02_interim/`.

### 3\. Phase 2: Hybrid Analytical Pipeline

**Objective:** To apply the core analytical techniques to the dataset to uncover themes and perform in-depth analysis on a subset of the data.

1.  **Topic Modeling with BERTopic**

      * **Action:** Preprocess the conversation text by cleaning and removing special characters to prepare it for embedding.
      * **Action:** Use the BERTopic library to create contextual embeddings of the text and cluster them into topics.
      * **Action:** Extract representative words for each cluster using c-TF-IDF to define and label the topics.
      * **Tools:** Python, BERTopic, Hugging Face `transformers`.
      * **Deliverable:** A script or notebook (`Task Files`) that executes the BERTopic analysis and outputs the identified topics and conversations associated with each topic.

2.  **Fine-Grained Analysis with LLMs & Semantic Tools**

      * **Action:** Select a subset of conversations from the topics identified by BERTopic for deeper analysis.
      * **Action:** Engineer specific prompts for the LLM to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, intent classification, and entity extraction. This is a zero-shot learning approach.
      * **Action:** Utilize dedicated NLP libraries for additional semantic analysis. Tools like **spaCy** can be used to extract user interests by identifying key nouns and named entities. We can also analyze which products or services were mentioned (displayed or recommended) by looking for product names within the conversations.
      * **Action:** Programmatically call the OpenAI API to process the conversation snippets and append the results back to the dataset.
      * **Tools:** Python, `openai` library, `requests` library, and specialized NLP libraries like **spaCy**.
      * **Deliverable:** A script or notebook (`Task Files`) that manages the API calls and integrates the LLM's and other NLP tools' outputs into the dataset. The enriched dataset will be saved to `data/03_processed/`.

### 4\. Phase 3: Insights Generation & Documentation

**Objective:** To synthesize the analytical findings into a clear, actionable report and finalize all project documentation.

1.  **Final Insights Document Creation**
      * **Action:** Summarize the key findings from all analyses, including visualizations of topic frequencies, semantic trends, and user interests.
      * **Action:** Use specific conversational snippets as examples to illustrate the key insights.
      * **Action:** Provide clear links between the data-driven insights and potential brand strategies, aligning with the project's vision.
      * **Deliverable:** A `final_insights.md` file in the `reports/` folder that serves as a high-level summary for stakeholders.

-----

### 5\. Testing & Maintenance

**Objective:** To ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the project, and to create the necessary documentation for future development and troubleshooting.

1.  **Testing Suite Development**

      * **Action:** Create a `/tests` folder in the repository.
      * **Action:** Develop unit tests for key functions in the `src/` directory, such as data cleaning and preprocessing utilities.
      * **Action:** Implement integration tests to verify that different components of the pipeline (e.g., data loading and topic modeling) work together correctly.
      * **Tools:** A testing framework like `pytest`.
      * **Deliverable:** A comprehensive testing suite that ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

2.  **Build Documentation**

      * **Action:** Create a `Build Documentation` folder at the root of the repository.
      * **Action:** Within this folder, create the following documents to assist with project management:
          * `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Troubleshooting.md`: To document solutions for common issues and errors.
          * `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/structure.md`: To provide an overview of the project's file and folder structure.
          * `/Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/AI_Chat_Conversation_Analysis_Take_Home_Interview/Build Documentation/Sprint-Progress.md`: To track project milestones and progress.
      * **Deliverable:** A dedicated documentation folder that supports the AI Coder and ensures project clarity.
